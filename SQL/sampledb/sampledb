Although Snapchat is my main social app on my phone, it has been really bugging me. For example, it has been taking up to 5 minutes to send a chat everytime I try to send something. Before I am told my phone is slow, let me reassure you this is not only a problem for me but for my peers as well. Also, I have been receiving Snapchatâ€™s from WEEKS ago, leaving the other person to conclude I have been ignoring them. When it is taking 4 weeks for a singular snap to come through, there is an obvious problem with the app. Likewise, my peers and I have noticed that when somebody responds to me, itâ€™s very slow and wonâ€™t load or I donâ€™t get it at all. Just the other day I received a snap, and when I asked about it I learned it had said I left them on opened whereas for me it said I had been left on delivered. The amount of time I have wasted trying to solve this problem along with the taking 5 minutes to send one thing problem, I could have been doing other things, so I have been veering off the app. Unfortunately, I do not think this app will be worth it, especially if it keeps traveling downhill at this rate. Maybe, if we werenâ€™t so worried about how the app looks we could worry about how it has been working.

So Iâ€™ll have like 2 or 3 stories in my memories that are similar but not all the same. So I just combine all of them and they would organize themselves by post date and I can get rid of the duplicates and have it be a nice, organized story just like how I posted them. But now, I donâ€™t know what happened, but I think an update ruined how my stories organize. Whenever I combine my stories so that I can organize it, they wonâ€™t organize themselves by post date anymore. They just add to the end so the memory is now all wonky and out of place and Iâ€™m very disappointed. I wanna be able to add stuff to my snap memories so whenever I look back at them, I can relive the whole day of when I posted those again. Please fix this Snapchat. It was completely fine before! At least make it to where you can individually move a snap to wherever in the memory you want it.

Iâ€™ve had Snapchat for over 4 years now, and this is the worst update by far, the format is completely different and way more complicated. We use to be able to open a message with sliding our finger across the person name, but now when we slide it bring us to snap maps, leaving us to tap the message instead of being able to slide. The benefits of sliding is if we are able to slide we are able to have a peak at the message before we fully open it, so if someone is bothering and you donâ€™t want to respond, or youâ€™re ghosting someone you were able to read their messages without them knowing. Because of this update people who has been using Snapchat for years has to get use to tapping instead of sliding. Also I preferred if snap maps didnâ€™t have its own page, and it was like it was previously, where you can pinch your fingers on the camera to access snap maps. And the final problem is at the bottom there are 4 icons, as if it wasnâ€™t clear before on the purpose of these things, it makes it looks very Androidy and unprofessional. I can also suggest you allowing us to change our usernames so we arenâ€™t stuck with the stupid/immature ones we came up with as a kid.

It changes the flow a bit too much and there are now some features that donâ€™t exist anymore. I do like being able to access the snap map better by clicking on it however I do not like that when I swipe to the left instead of opening a conversation it goes to the map. Many of us would rather be able to swipe into our conversations like we used to. I understand that the update was most likely a lot of work but I think it would be nice if we could get the option to decide if swiping left will open chats or the map. May be in a next update you can add in a feature in our settings where you can pick whether swiping left or open the map or your chats Iâ€™m sure many people would appreciate it although I do understand it would take a lot of work.

Iâ€™ve noticed that thumbnails change after you go through the story, so that makes it hard to find what you clicked on in the first place.

Though I only watched it 5 minutes ago.â€ Thus I would propose a sort of â€œhistoryâ€ feature for the â€œfor youâ€ page.

Number one is the fact that when I send or receive streaks, that they will send or show twice, which is very annoying. Second, it glitches and tells me that I have to go back and re-add everyone that I have on snap because I don''t have them added already. And last but not least, is that fact that sometimes it freezes when you try a filter on, or write something on a picture.
